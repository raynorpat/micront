Routine Description:

    An application is required to perform a (successful) WSAStartup()
    call before it can use Windows Sockets services.  When it has
    completed the use of Windows Sockets, the application may call
    WSACleanup() to deregister itself from a Windows Sockets
    implementation.

Arguments:

    None.

Return Value:

    The return value is 0 if the operation was successful.  Otherwise
    the value SOCKET_ERROR is returned, and a specific error number may
    be retrieved by calling WSAGetLastError().

int PASCAL
WSAStartup (
    WORD wVersionRequired,
    LPWSADATA lpWsaData
    )

/*++

Routine Description:

    This function MUST be the first Windows Sockets function called by
    an application.  It allows an application to specify the version of
    Windows Sockets API required and to retrieve details of the specific
    Windows Sockets implementation.  The application may only issue
    further Windows Sockets API functions after a successful
    WSAStartup() invocation.

    In order to support future Windows Sockets implementations and
    applications which may have functionality differences from Windows
    Sockets 1.0, a negotiation takes place in WSAStartup().  An
    application passes to WSAStartup() the highest Windows Sockets
    version that it can take advantage of.  If this version is lower
    than the lowest version supported by the Windows Sockets DLL, the
    DLL cannot support the application and WSAStartup() returns
    WSAVERNOTSUPPORTED.  Otherwise, the DLL will attempt to register the
    application as a client: if this fails, WSAStartup() fails and
    returns WSASYSNOTREADY.  If the DLL can support the application and
    the registration process succeeds, .the function stores the highest
    version of Windows Sockets supported by the DLL in the wHighVersion
    element of the WSAData structure and returns 0.  If wHighVersion is
    lower than the lowest version supported by the application, the
    application either fails its initialization or attempts to find
    another Windows Sockets DLL on the system.

    This negotiation allows both a Windows Sockets DLL and a Windows
    Sockets application to support a range of Windows Sockets versions.
    An application can successfully utilize a DLL if there is any
    overlap in the versions.  The following chart gives examples of how
    WSAStartup() works in conjunction with different application and DLL
    versions:

    App       DLL       wVersionRequired  wHighVersion  Result
    versions  Versions

    1.0       1.0       1.0               1.0           use
                                                        1.0

    1.0 2.0   1.0       2.0               1.0           use
                                                        1.0

    1.0       1.0 2.0   1.0               2.0           use

    1.0       2.0 3.0   1.0               (failure)     fail

    2.0 3.0   1.0       3.0               1.0           fail

    1.0 2.0   1.0 2.0   3.0               3.0           use

    Once an application has made a successful WSAStartup() call, it may
    proceed to make other Windows Sockets API calls as needed.  When it
    has finished using the services of the Windows Sockets DLL, the
    application should call WSACleanup().

    Details of the actual Windows Sockets implementation are described
    in the WSAData structure defined as follows:

    struct WSAData {
         WORD wVersion;
         WORD wHighVersion;
         char szDescription[WSADESCRIPTION_LEN+1];
         char szSystemStatus[WSASYSSTATUS_LEN+1];
         int  iMaxSockets;
         int  iMaxUdpDg;
         char FAR *     lpVendorInfo
    };

    The members of this structure are:

    Element        Usage

    wVersion - The version of the Windows Sockets DLL, encoded as for
        wVersionRequired.

    wHighVersion - The highest version of the Windows Sockets
        specification that this DLL can support (also encoded as above).
        Normally this will be the same as wVersion.

    szDescription - A null-terminated ASCII string into which the
        Windows Sockets DLL copies a description of the Windows Sockets
        implementation, including vendor identification.  The text (up
        to 256 characters in length) may contain any characters, but
        vendors are cautioned against including control and formatting
        characters: the most likely use that an application will put
        this to is to display it (possibly truncated) in a status
        message.

    szSystemStatus - A null-terminated ASCII string into which the
        Windows Sockets DLL copies relevant status or configuration
        information.  The Windows Sockets DLL should use this field only
        if the information might be useful to the user or support staff:
        it should not be considered as an extension of the szDescription
        field.

    iMaxSockets - The maximum number of sockets which a single process
        can potentially open.  A Windows Sockets implementation may
        provide a global pool of sockets for allocation to any process;
        alternatively it may allocate per-process resources for sockets.
        The number may well reflect the way in which the Windows Sockets
        DLL or the networking software was configured.  Application
        writers may use this number as a crude indication of whether the
        Windows Sockets implementation is usable by the application.
        For example, an X Windows server might check iMaxSockets when
        first started: if it is less than 8, the application would
        display an error message instructing the user to reconfigure the
        networking software.  (This is a situation in which the
        szSystemStatus text might be used.) Obviously there is no
        guarantee that a particular application can actually allocate
        iMaxSockets sockets, since there may be other Windows Sockets
        applications in use.

    iMaxUdpDg - The size in bytes of the largest UDP datagram that can
        be sent or received by a Windows Sockets application.  If the
        implementation imposes no limit, iMaxUdpDg is zero.  In many
        implementations of Berkeley sockets, there is an implicit limit
        of 8192 bytes on UDP datagrams (which are fragmented if
        necessary).  A Windows Sockets implementation may impose a limit
        based, for instance, on the allocation of fragment reassembly
        buffers.  The minimum value of iMaxUdpDg for a compliant Windows
        Sockets implementation is 512.  Note that regardless of the
        value of iMaxUdpDg, it is inadvisable to attempt to send a
        broadcast datagram which is larger than the Maximum Transmission
        Unit (MTU) for the network.  (The Windows Sockets API does not
        provide a mechanism to discover the MTU, but it must be no less
        than 512 bytes.)

    lpVendorInfo - A far pointer to a vendor-specific data structure.
        The definition of this structure (if supplied) is beyond the
        scope of this specification.

Arguments:

    None.

Return Value:

    WSAStartup() returns zero if successful.  Otherwise it returns one
    of the error codes listed below.  Note that the normal mechanism
    whereby the application calls WSAGetLastError() to determine the
    error code cannot be used, since the Windows Sockets DLL may not
    have established the client data area where the "last error"
    information is stored.

Routine Description:

    Performs a control operation on a socket.  This implementation supports
    only the synchronous control codes a Winsock 1.1-era BSD application needs;
    it is not the full Winsock 2 ioctl surface.

    Specifically:

        SIO_KEEPALIVE_VALS - enable/disable TCP keepalive on a connected VC
            socket.  The tcp_keepalive 'onoff' field is honored for real (it is
            pushed through AFD to the TCP transport).  The 'keepalivetime' and
            'keepaliveinterval' fields are accepted but NOT applied per-socket:
            this TCP is NT4-era and uses global keepalive timers
            (KeepAliveTime/KeepAliveInterval).  Per-socket timers
            (TCP_SOCKET_KEEPALIVE_VALS) are a Windows 2000 feature and are not
            implemented here.

    Everything else -- SIO_RCVALL (promiscuous capture; out of scope on a
    single-NIC, non-routing host), SIO_GET_EXTENSION_FUNCTION_POINTER
    (AcceptEx/ConnectEx), and any overlapped request -- is rejected with
    WSAEOPNOTSUPP so that this one entry point cannot pull in the overlapped /
    IOCP / mswsock surface.

Arguments:

    s - A descriptor identifying a socket.

    dwIoControlCode - The control code of the operation to perform.

    lpvInBuffer - A pointer to the input buffer.

    cbInBuffer - The size, in bytes, of the input buffer.

    lpvOutBuffer - A pointer to the output buffer (unused here).

    cbOutBuffer - The size, in bytes, of the output buffer (unused here).

    lpcbBytesReturned - A pointer to the actual number of bytes of output.

    lpOverlapped - A pointer to a WSAOVERLAPPED structure.  Must be NULL --
        overlapped operation is not supported.

    lpCompletionRoutine - A completion routine.  Must be NULL.

Return Value:

    Upon successful completion, WSAIoctl() returns 0.  Otherwise a value of
    SOCKET_ERROR is returned, and a specific error code may be retrieved by
    calling WSAGetLastError().
