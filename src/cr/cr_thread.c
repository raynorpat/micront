/*
 * cr_thread.c — C escape-hatch for spawning an OS thread that runs Lua
 * code in its own fresh lua_State.
 *
 * Why this is C, not Lua:
 *
 *   The thread entry passed to RtlCreateUserThread must be a real
 *   native function. An FFI callback (ffi.cast on a Lua function)
 *   re-enters the originating lua_State on invocation, which would
 *   corrupt the parent's VM since lua_State is single-threaded.
 *   Bringing up a fresh state on a new thread therefore requires
 *   native code — this file.
 *
 *   This is the architectural rule for cr's top-level C files: each
 *   one must justify itself with a "Lua + FFI cannot express this
 *   safely" reason. New additions need the same justification or they
 *   belong in lua/ as raw FFI.
 *
 * Lifetime model:
 *
 *   Everything the spawned thread reads or writes — the chunk source,
 *   the payload, the output buffer, the done event, and the
 *   CR_THREAD struct itself — is allocated on the process heap (the
 *   one PEB->ProcessHeap that NT 3.5's RtlAllocateHeap is internally
 *   thread-safe on). Nothing comes from Lua's GC.
 *
 *   Ownership is a 2-count refcount: parent and thread each hold one
 *   ref at spawn. Either party drops their ref when done with ctx
 *   (parent in _cr_thread_close, thread at end of _entry). Whoever
 *   atomically decrements to zero is the last toucher and runs
 *   _free_all. Neither party ever blocks the other; in particular
 *   _cr_thread_close NEVER calls NtTerminateThread (which would leak
 *   loader/heap critical sections held by the thread) and NEVER waits.
 *
 *   Crash safety: if the chunk takes the thread down before _entry's
 *   exit path runs (uncaught native exception, chunk-self-
 *   NtTerminateThread, stack overflow, ...), the thread's _release
 *   never fires and ctx would leak forever. To prevent this,
 *   _cr_thread_close polls thread_handle; if signaled and the
 *   thread_released CAS-flag is still 0, the parent claims the
 *   thread's reference and drops it on the thread's behalf. The flag
 *   is set in _entry's exit path before _release, so a normal exit
 *   loses the CAS race against the parent (intended).
 *
 *   Status reporting: ctx->status is initialised to STATUS_CRASH (3)
 *   at spawn. _entry's exit path overwrites it with 0 (chunk returned
 *   ok), 1 (chunk raised a Lua error), or 2 (couldn't even create a
 *   lua_State). If the parent reads 3 it knows the thread terminated
 *   without running its exit path — i.e. crashed.
 *
 * TLS:
 *
 *   Chunks have no TLS surface — TlsAlloc/TlsFree are not exposed via
 *   the cr Lua API. lua_State is per-thread by construction; nothing
 *   inside cr_thread or the standard nt.* modules calls TlsAlloc.
 *   Defensive auto-cleanup machinery (per-spawn bitmap, hooks into
 *   librt's TlsAlloc) was removed once we confirmed there is no
 *   consumer to track. If a future cr feature needs per-spawn TLS
 *   tracking, an opt-in cr.tls_alloc wrapper is the right shape;
 *   don't reintroduce the always-on hooks.
