## NtQuerySystemInformation

Source: [`EX/SYSINFO.C`](../../src/NT/PRIVATE/NTOS/EX/SYSINFO.C) · service #106

The biggest info-class switch in the kernel.  ~50
`SYSTEM_INFORMATION_CLASS` values covering processor info,
memory stats, process list, handle table, performance counters,
modules list, etc.  Each arm probes the output buffer once at
entry, then per-class population.

- [x] C1 Probe-then-deref TOCTOU — single probe at top.
- [x] C2 Direct user-pointer deref without capture — output only.
- [x] C3 Missing `__try` wrap — accesses inside try.
- [x] C4 Length-field trust — `SystemInformationLength` checked
  against per-class minimum.
- [x] C5 Integer overflow in size computation
  - `SystemProcessInformation`, `SystemHandleInformation`,
    and `SystemModuleInformation` accumulate per-entry sizes;
    each entry's size is bounded.  No per-element multiply
    with attacker-controlled factor.
- [x] C6 Semantic validation gaps — per-class info-class enum
  validated.  Some classes are kernel-mode-only; the others
  are unprivileged in NT 3.5.
- C7 IOCTL access-bit encoding — N/A
- C8 Output buffer aliasing / METHOD mismatch — N/A
- [x] C9 Pool exhaustion via attacker-controlled allocation
  - Handle-table snapshot is sized by the system-wide handle
    count; bounded by aggregate handle quota.
- [ ] C10 Uninitialized output / pool-contents leak
  - Per-class output structs filled field-by-field; padding
    between fields is not defensively zeroed.  Latent leak
    risk shared with `NtQueryInformationProcess` / `…Thread`
    family.
- [x] C11 Reference-count discipline under error paths
  - Snapshot routines (`ExSnapShotHandleTables`,
    `MmSnapshot…`) hold internal locks while walking; release
    them on every exit.
- [ ] C12 Kernel-address / kernel-pointer leak via info classes — **finding (severe)**
  - `SystemHandleInformation` arm calls
    `ObGetHandleInformation` → `ObpCaptureHandleInformation`
    (`OBHANDLE.C:1584`) which **explicitly copies
    `NonPagedObjectHeader->Object`** into the
    `SYSTEM_HANDLE_TABLE_ENTRY_INFO.Object` field returned to
    user.  This is a raw kernel object pointer.
  - **Reachability**: unprivileged in NT 3.5.  Any process can
    call `NtQuerySystemInformation(SystemHandleInformation,
    …)` and receive a list of every handle in the system
    paired with its kernel-object-pointer.  Defeats kernel-
    ASLR-equivalent assumptions and feeds into corruption
    primitives (now you know where every `EPROCESS`,
    `ETHREAD`, file object, etc. lives).
  - Modern Windows gates this behind `SeDebugPrivilege` and
    zeroes the `Object` field for non-debug callers.  Same
    fix shape here.
  - `SystemProcessInformation` also returns kernel-derived
    state — `UniqueProcessId`, `InheritedFromUniqueProcessId`,
    `CreateTime`, image-name — but no raw kernel pointers.
    OK.
  - `SystemModuleInformation` returns loaded-module list with
    `ImageBase` — kernel-address disclosure (the module load
    addresses).  Unprivileged in NT 3.5.  Modern Windows
    requires `SeDebugPrivilege`.

  rather than removing the dispatch entry preserves the
  service-number layout; harmless.

## Fix-scope summary across EX

### Root-cause groups

1. **Output-handle leak (6 syscalls)** — `NtCreateEvent`,
   `NtCreateEventPair`, `NtCreateMutant`, `NtCreateSemaphore`,
   `NtCreateTimer`, `NtCreateProfile` plus their `NtOpen*`
   siblings (5).  Total **11 sites** with the same shape.

2. **`NtQuerySystemInformation` C12 — kernel-pointer
   disclosure** — `SystemHandleInformation` arm copies
   `NonPagedObjectHeader->Object` (raw kernel pointer) into
   user buffer via `ObGetHandleInformation` (`OBHANDLE.C:1619`).
   `SystemModuleInformation` discloses kernel module load
   addresses.  Both **unprivileged in NT 3.5**; both
   gated behind `SeDebugPrivilege` in modern Windows.

3. **Per-class struct padding (latent)** in
   `NtQuerySystemInformation` — same shape as other
   Query*Information family.

### Fix shape

1. **Output-handle leak (11 sites)** — same `NtClose(Handle)`
   cleanup template.

2. **`NtQuerySystemInformation` kernel-pointer leak** — gate
   the two leaky info classes behind `SeDebugPrivilege`:
   - `SystemHandleInformation` arm: check privilege; if not
     held, either fail with `STATUS_PRIVILEGE_NOT_HELD` or
     zero the `Object` field per entry before returning.
   - `SystemModuleInformation` arm: same — gate or zero
     `ImageBase`.
   - For unprivileged callers, the legitimate uses of these
     classes (Task Manager, Process Explorer's basic mode)
     don't need the raw pointers; modern Windows demonstrates
     that the gating is feasible without breaking real
     workloads.

3. **Defensive zero-init** on per-class info-class arms in
   `NtQuerySystemInformation` — same as PS/CONFIG advice.

### Clean classes

The vast majority of EX is mechanical sync-object plumbing
with no user-pointer surface beyond `HANDLE` outputs.
Mutant/Event/Semaphore/Timer query+set sigs are textbook.

`NtSystemDebugControl` is `SeDebugPrivilege`-gated and
deliberately exposes kernel state — by design.  The C10/C12
"findings" there are documented for completeness rather than
hardening.

`NtVdmControl` is a stub returning `STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`
since NTVDM was removed from MicroNT.

### Cross-references

- `ObGetHandleInformation` (`OBHANDLE.C:1619`) was already
  flagged during the OB audit as a known kernel-pointer
  source.  Confirmed reachable here.
- `NtSetSystemTime` / `NtSetSystemEnvironmentValue` /
  `NtSetIntervalProfile` / `NtSetTimerResolution` /
  `NtShutdownSystem` / `NtRaiseHardError` /
  `NtSetDefaultHardErrorPort` are all `Se*Privilege`-gated.
  The privilege names should be enumerated in a
  `KERNEL-ABI-HARDENING.md` cross-table.
